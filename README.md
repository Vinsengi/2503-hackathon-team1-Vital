## Design

### Colour Scheme

![screenshot](documentation/features/colours.png)

**Retro Vibe:** The design features a bold combination of Navy (`#000080`) and LightSkyBlue (`#87CEFA`) as seen in the footer gradient, evoking a nostalgic Windows 98 feel.  
**High Contrast:** The dark navbar (`bg-gray-900`) paired with white text and borders ensures excellent readability on large screens.  
**Accent Variety:** Subtle Silver (`#C0C0C0`) accents and well-defined hover effects add visual depth without detracting from the retro aesthetic.

### Fonts
The site uses fonts inspired by late 1990‚Äôs Web 1.0 aesthetics. In particular:

**Gentium Book Basic**  
A timeless serif font designed for readability with elegant letterforms and extensive language support‚Äîideal for biographies.

## Deployment

The web app is hosted on Heroku using Eco Dynos and is deployed via the designated GitHub repository.

**Deployment Process:**
1. Log in to your GitHub profile and **create a new repository**.
2. Open VS Code locally, connect to the workspace, and build the MVP.
3. Install the web server **gunicorn** and freeze requirements.
4. Create a new **Procfile** in the root directory specifying gunicorn as the process type.
5. Update `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in `settings.py` and set `DEBUG = False` for production. Commit and push these changes.
6. In Heroku, create a new app using a unique name and the correct region.
7. Add necessary **Config Vars** in the Heroku settings.
8. Go to the **Deploy** tab, connect the correct GitHub repository, and deploy the branch.
9. Choose **Automatic Deploy** for seamless updates.
10. Verify the deployed site using browser developer tools.
11. In the app's Resources tab, confirm Eco Dynos are in use and remove unnecessary add-ons.
12. Future changes should be pushed to GitHub and deployed on Heroku accordingly.
