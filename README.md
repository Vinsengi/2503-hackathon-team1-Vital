# Project Title

## User Experience

### Site Goals
Our app is designed to inspire the next generation of tech innovators by:
- sharing stories of women pioneers in tech
- providing handy tips into tech
- bridging the mentorship gap for women in technology by connecting mentees with mentors who can guide their professional journeys.

The web app aims to break barriers, close gender gaps and cultivate a diverse and inclusive tech community where women can thrive as innovators, leaders and changemakers. It’s not just about mentorship — it’s about building a stronger future for women in technology.

## Agile Methodology

### Kanban Board
All user stories were logged on the [Kanban Project Board](https://github.com/users/tgrey2024/projects/21) on GitHub Projects.

We also used it during testing to log any significant bugs that need to be fixed before the deadline. These were then assigned and prioritised alongside other issues and user stories.

### User Stories
Here are all the user stories that have been prioritised for the current implementation:

| User Stories                                    | MoSCoW priority           |  Status |
|:----------------------------------------------- |:-------------------------:|:-------:|
| User-Friendly Navigation and Responsive Design  | must have                 |   Done  |

## Deployment
The web app is hosted on Heroku using Eco Dynos, and is deployed via the designated Github repository.

The deployment process is as follows:
1. Login to your GitHub profile and **Create a new repository**.
2. Open VS Code locally, connect and open the workspace. Create the MVP.
3. Install web server gunicorn and freeze requirements.
4. Create a new Procfile in the root directory and specify the running of the web app with process type as gunicorn in the Procfile.
5. Add deployed apps to ALLOWED_HOSTS in settings.py, and set Debug = False. Add, commit and push to the Github repo.
6. In Heroku, create a new app using a unique name and select the correct region. 
7. Add Config Vars in Settings.
8. Go to Deploy tab, search for the correct Github repo and **Deploy Branch**.
9. **View app** to verify that it is been deployed correctly. This deployed site can now be validated and tested e.g. in Chrome Dev Tools.
10. In the app's Resources tab, check that Eco Dynos are used and remove any unnecessary Add-ons.
11. Subsequent changes to the code will need to be pushed to the Github repo and deployed on Heroku.
