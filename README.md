## User Experience

### Site Goals
Our app is designed to inspire the next generation of tech innovators by:
- sharing stories of women pioneers in tech
- providing handy tips into tech
- bridging the mentorship gap for women in technology by connecting mentees with mentors who can guide their professional journeys.

The web app aims to break barriers, close gender gaps and cultivate a diverse and inclusive tech community where women can thrive as innovators, leaders and changemakers. It‚Äôs not just about mentorship ‚Äî it‚Äôs about building a stronger future for women in technology.

## Design

### Colour Scheme
We draw from a palette of colours commonly found on operating systems in the 90's, taking inspiring from the cool retro colours of the Windows 98 operating system:
![Colour scheme](documentation/features/colours.png)

### Fonts
The site uses a selection of fonts inspired by Web 1.0 pages from the late 1990's:

**Gentium Book Basic**
This is a timeless serif font designed for readability, featuring elegant letterforms and support for a wide range of languages and scripts, making it ideal for the biographies.

### Wireframes
Based on the user stories, we used Balsamiq to design the wireframes for the main UI, starting with mobile first.

## Agile Methodology

### Kanban Board
All user stories were logged on the [Kanban Project Board](https://github.com/users/tgrey2024/projects/21) on GitHub Projects.

We also used it during testing to log any significant bugs that need to be fixed before the deadline. These were then assigned and prioritised alongside other issues and user stories.

### User Stories
Here are all the user stories that have been prioritised for the current implementation:

| User Stories                                   | MoSCoW priority | Status |

## Features

### Header
![Header](documentation/features/header.png)
#### Header Section Overview
The header of this project is designed with a retro-modern and responsive layout to provide easy navigation across the site, with a touch of 1980s. It includes the following key components:
### Structure and Design
#### Background Gradient
* The header has a linear gradient that transitions from a dark blue (#000080) to a light sky blue (#87CEFA), giving it a visually appealing look. The text color is white, ensuring good contrast and readability.
#### Logo
* The logo is placed on the left side and links to the home page. It's styled to ensure that it fits well in the header without distorting or overflowing, using a max-w-full and max-h-full approach.
#### Navigation Links
* The horizontal navigation menu is displayed on larger screens (medium and up, md breakpoint) with links to key pages: Home, Timeline, Mentors, Team, Login and Register. These links have hover effects for better user interaction.
* If the user is authenticated, additional links for "Logout" and "Change Password" are displayed. Otherwise, users will see the "Login" and "Register" options.
### Mobile Responsiveness
* On smaller screens, the navigation links are hidden, and a hamburger menu (navbar-burger) appears.
* When clicked, it toggles a dropdown menu (navbar-dropdown) showing the same navigation links as in the desktop version.
* The dropdown menu is styled to appear below the hamburger button with a light background and rounded corners.
### Footer
![Footer](documentation/features/footer.png)
* The footer is styled with a dark blue background (#000080), white text, and a subtle border on top.

* The text is centered, and the font is set to a monospace style (font-mono), with a small size (text-sm).

* It includes a copyright notice with the text "404 Gender Gap Not Found - Since 1900", followed by "All Rights Reserved".

* This footer is fixed at the bottom of the page (mt-auto), ensuring it stays at the bottom even if content above it is not enough to fill the screen.

### Timeline
* The timeline feature is a tribute to the trailblazing women who have shaped the world of technology through their pioneering achievements, starting with the pioneer, Ada Lovelace, often hailed as the world's first computer programmer. It presents an engaging and interactive journey through history, highlighting key figures and their groundbreaking contributions to fields like computing, engineering, game design, web accessibility and more. Each entry includes a snapshot of their life, notable accomplishments and the lasting impact of their work, providing inspiration for users of all ages. By showcasing these remarkable stories, the timeline not only honours these innovators but also encourages future generations to follow in their footsteps and continue breaking barriers in tech.

#### Read more
* The user is invited to know more about any figure by clicking on the Read more button to find out more about each tech icon.

#### Honor Her - Heart
* Users can honors the women featured on our timeline by giving them a heart - clicking on the heart icon.

### Tips
### Contact Mentor Form
* User may find a mentor from the pool of mentors on our mentors page.
* If a user finds no matching mentor right away, the user may click on the "Find a mentor" button
* A contact a mentor window will pop up and the user may provide his/heremial, mentor name and a message.
* The sytem will then try to match the user with a mentor.

The web app is hosted on Heroku using Eco Dynos, and is deployed via the designated Github repository.

The deployment process is as follows:
1. Login to your GitHub profile and **Create a new repository**.
2. Open VS Code locally, connect and open the workspace. Create the MVP.
3. Install web server gunicorn and freeze requirements.
4. Create a new Procfile in the root directory and specify the running of the web app with process type as gunicorn in the Procfile.
5. Add deployed apps to ALLOWED_HOSTS in settings.py, and set Debug = False. Add, commit and push to the Github repo.
6. In Heroku, create a new app using a unique name and select the correct region.
7. Add Config Vars in Settings.
8. Go to Deploy tab, search for the correct Github repo and **Deploy Branch**.
9. Choose **Automatic Deploy**.
10. **View app** to verify that it is been deployed correctly. This deployed site can now be validated and tested e.g. in Chrome Dev Tools.
11. In the app's Resources tab, check that Eco Dynos are used and remove any unnecessary Add-ons.
12. Subsequent changes to the code will need to be pushed to the Github repo and deployed on Heroku.

## Creating A Fork
1. On Github navigate to repository
2. click "Fork" located towards the top right corner
3. Select "owner" for the forked repo, from the dropdown menu under "owner" Under "Owner"
4. It will create forked repo under the same name as orinial by default but you can type a name in "Repository name" or add a description in "Description" box.
5. Click "Create fork" !

Forking allows you to make any changes without affecting original project. You can send the suggestions over by submitting pull request. Project owner can review the pull request before accepting the suggestions and merging them.


For more details on how to fork the repo, in order to for example suggest any changes to the project you can visit:
https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo

When you have fork to a repository you don't have access to files locally on your device, for this you will need to clone the forked repo.

## Cloning the Repository

1. On Github navigate to repository
2. Click "Code" a green button shown right above the file list
3. Copy the URL of the repo using HTTPS, SSH OR Github CLI
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory
6. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied earlier
7. Press enter to create local Clone
